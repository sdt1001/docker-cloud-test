<h1>ASIA</h1>
<h3>
Asia is the largest continent in area and population covering 1/3 of the world’s surface and 60% of the world’s population: 6.8-7 billion people in the world. 1/3 of the world’s population are in India and China combined. Asia is still in the latter stages of a population explosion. In China, the population rate is down to 1% a year. India is closing in on China’s population very quickly. The continent was heavily colonized from the 1500s to the 1800s when Asian civilizations were in decline, especially economically while the European culture was on the rise. Colonization peaked in the mid-1900s. 
Monsoon Asia: 18% of the earth’s surface. Home to over 4 billion people. Highest population density in the world while using and abusing water sources more than anywhere else. Enormous physical and human variety – the closeness of the people to the earth. The rhythm of the seasonal farming cycles dominates the region’s life. Traditional farming methods are still the norm for about 1 billion of Monsoon Asia’s inhabitants. India needs to create 15 million jobs per year to keep pace with population growth. Lack of such jobs creates poverty, misery and social/political instability. Improvements in livelihood have taken place in this region, even in India. They have a more educated population than ever before and pretty much have their population growth in line with job creation. College educated Indians are available for hire to American companies for less pay and benefits, and more hours while willing to work nights and weekends. 
Monsoon Asia has been populated since before recorded time. Multiple culture hearths like the Indus River and Huanghe River. 3 of the 4 top populated countries are here: China, India and Indonesia (also the most populous Muslim nation in the world). Alluvial valley areas have the highest density of any area in Monsoon Asia. Chan Jian (formerly Yangtze) River, Xi River in China, Ganges in India/Bangladesh. Red River starting in China into Vietnam. Chao Phraya (Chow Pryah) river in Thailand. Mekong starting in China into Laos, Cambodia and southern part of Vietnam. With 3 exceptions these river valleys are where everyone lives. The exceptions are: peninsula India (which receives a lot of rain from monsoons), Loess plateau (extremely fine grain, productive soil) of China and the island of Java in Indonesia (volcanic island) considered the largest density island in the world. 
People avoid the arid area of western and northwestern China and Mongolia. Safe to say that Monsoon Asian people have gathered and proliferated wherever the agriculture potential was the greatest. 
Water is the key player in Monsoon Asia; how accessible it is determines where people cluster the most. Away from navigable areas, the population stagnated and eventually migrated.
